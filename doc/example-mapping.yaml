    # the separator used in keys after the source array is flattened, e.g. a
    # source array will be flattened as follows (using json structure for
    # brevity):
    #
    # {
    #   "some_key": {
    #     "some_subkey": "some_value"
    #   }
    # }

    #
    # {
    #   "some_key.some_subkey": "some_value"

      some.key: 2

  # result types can be enforces by specifying the type in brackets after
  # the key name. if omitted, no type casts will be performed. type casts
  # are performed as the last step of the transformation

    # inverse defines the target key to map the direct key ("somekey") to
    inverse: some.key[float]

    # the value of the target key will be computed using a formula. formulas
    # support basic math operations such as +,-,*,/ and can make use of
    # parenthesis as well as variables. allowed variables are basically all
    # existing keys of the source array

      direct: some.key * 10

    # value mappings can be used to map certain source values to target values.
    # please note that value mappings are ignored if formulas are defined.
    value_mapping:
      # defines the default target value if no mapping is defined for the
      # source value
      #   'set_null' (default) : the target will be null
      #   'pass_through'       : just pass through the source value to the
      #                          target
      #   <array>              : if it is an array, it will be treated as
      #                          a callable with the source value as first
      #                          parameter, e.g.:
      #                          [Some\Namespace\SomeClass, someFunc]
      default: [Some\Namespace\SomeClass, resolveDefaultValue]
